# stock_tradin_backtest_analysis_using_streamlit
In this project, I've tried to automate EDA using streamlit. I'd 150+ stock where I have to perform EDA for Model Building but It was a very time consuming task so created a Streamlit App where I can just select the stock I want & the kind of EDA I need to perform, It will show the result thereby need not to write codes again & again for every stock & following "DRY" concept : Do Not Repat Yourself.
